NYC Yellow Taxi Demand Prediction using Machine Learning

Business Understanding
In 2011, Uber was launched and since then the usage of yellow taxis came to a decline. It mostly happened because Uber allowed anyone to enroll as a taxi driver with their own private 
vehicle and making it as easy as a click on the UBer app to book a ride. 

Solution:- To make an application with a great UI or We can do analysis and leverage machine learning to help the drivers relocate to a place with higher demand.

Objective:- 
1) Do intensive data analysis to give a tip to drivers on when and where in particular they can find demand.
2) Predict the number of pickups as accurate as possible for each region in a given time interval.

Sub-Problem for ML mapping:-
1) Dividing NYC into smaller regions - Unsupervised ML
2) Time Series prediction problem - Predicting the number of pickups

Performance Metric Used:-
Mean Absolute Precentage Error
